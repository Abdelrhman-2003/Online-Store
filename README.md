# Online Store

A simple **E-commerce** application built with **PHP** and **MySQL** using a custom **MVC architecture**. This project was created as a learning experience to understand how modern web applications work behind the scenes without relying on frameworks.

The application demonstrates core backend concepts such as routing, controllers, views, database interaction, and CRUD operations while following clean code practices and object-oriented programming principles.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdelrhman-2003/Online-Store.git

cd Online-Store
```

---

### 2. Install Composer Dependencies

Install the project dependencies and generate the Composer autoloader:

```bash
composer install
```
---
 

### 3. Create the Database

Create a new database named:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE online_store;
```

---

## Create the Database Tables

Run the following SQL statements to create the required tables for the project. These tables define the database structure for storing categories and products.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Categories (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    categoryName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    categoryDescription TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    productName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    productDescription TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    category_id INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Categories(id)
);
```

---

### 4. Configure the Database

Open:

```text
src/config/database.php
```

Update your database credentials.

Example:

```php
return [
    "default" => "mysql",

    "connections" => [
        "mysql" => [

            "dbname"   => "online_store",
            "host"     => "localhost",
            "port"     => 3306,
            "username" => "root",
            "password" => ""

        ]
    ]
];
```
---

### 5. Verify PHP Installation

Run:

```bash
php -v
```

You should see PHP **8.0** or later.

---

### 6. Start the Development Server

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t Public/
```

Open your browser:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

If everything is configured correctly, the application should load successfully.

---

## Database Structure

The application uses a relational MySQL database to organize products, categories, colors, and sizes.

### Categories

Stores all product categories.

| Column              | Description           |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| id                  | Primary key           |
| categoryName        | Category name         |
| categoryDescription | Category description  |
| created_at          | Creation timestamp    |
| updated_at          | Last update timestamp |

---

### Products

Stores the application's products.

| Column             | Description                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| id                 | Primary key                |
| productName        | Product name               |
| productDescription | Product description        |
| price              | Product price              |
| category_id        | References `categories.id` |
| created_at         | Creation timestamp         |
| updated_at         | Last update timestamp      |

---

### Colors

Stores the available colors.

| Column     | Description           |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| id         | Primary key           |
| colorName  | Color name            |
| created_at | Creation timestamp    |
| updated_at | Last update timestamp |

---

### Sizes

Stores the available product sizes.

| Column     | Description           |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| id         | Primary key           |
| sizeName   | Size name             |
| created_at | Creation timestamp    |
| updated_at | Last update timestamp |

---

### Product_Color

A pivot table that represents the many-to-many relationship between products and colors.

---

### Product_Size

A pivot table that represents the many-to-many relationship between products and sizes.

---

### Database Relationships

* One **Category** can contain many **Products**.
* One **Product** belongs to one **Category**.
* One **Product** can have multiple **Colors**.
* One **Color** can belong to multiple **Products**.
* One **Product** can have multiple **Sizes**.
* One **Size** can belong to multiple **Products**.
